## Release and supported OS

This fork has as unique goal to try to keep supporting the Acqualung i330R and the Apex DSX as these two devices uses a
non standard bluetooth pairing, which ask to input a PIN.
If you have one of these two devices and want to use Subsurface, feel free to try this version.

The release number will reflects the one used by upstream. Probably I will not build a new release for every new release   from upstream but I will try to keep it as updated as possible. 

The supported OS are only Linux (via AppImage) and MacOs. Windows do not allow the bluetooth pairing mechanish used byt the i330R.
